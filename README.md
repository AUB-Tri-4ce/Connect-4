## Description
A console-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game in C. 
Two players (A and B) take turns dropping checkers into a 6x7 grid. 
The first player to connect four of their checkers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
If the grid fills up with no winner, the game ends in a tie.

This project is designed to run on **Linux**.
